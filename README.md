# Fractals as a Service (FaaS)

## Introducion
FaaS is a fractal generator with a web frontend and realtime server-side rendering. Initial support includes Mandelbrot and Julia sets, with more sets as well as animation support still to come.

## Internals
Node and Express are used to run the web frontend, with Python taking care of rendering fractals behind the scenes.
